I chose my school because it had a computer science class but, you know, 2 hours per week just aren't enough.
Now the school year has ended, and I can spend some of my free time studying what I enjoy, so I searched which were the best courses for computer science and here I am right now.
I also decided to write this blog, primarly to make myself a little more sure I will finish this course, secondly because I just enjoy writing experiences.
To be honest, today is the second day. I already have passed the first week assignment, so I will write this trying to remember everything I can.

Enrolling CS50x was more confusing than I was expecting, even though it's actually very well designed. More than one time I confused CS50x with CS50, but I made it out alive.
I watched the first lesson and, to be honest, it was mostly things I already knew. But the course is designed for complete beginners, and I have a little background, so I expected it a little.
Scratch was really funny though. In the start I didn't know what to make, then scrolling the sprites I found a earth sprite and the ideas came in. It probably wasn't the most original idea in the world, but it was fun to create. I have used scratch since I was a kid, in my country teachers really push it I have to say, so making the project wasn't that hard. Still, I'm a little worried I made a mistake. I won't go into details, but I probaby have. I'm waiting to see if I will recieve a feedback. If I will, I'll fix it. 

Anyway, this is mostly it for the first day. Now I'm going to go fixing this github page cause it's driving me nuts, than I will probably write the 2 day.
Byeee
