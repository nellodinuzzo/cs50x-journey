title: "Day 6 - Lab 2 & Problem Set 2"

Ok today I've worked a lot. I started by doing the Lab 2. It was fairly easy to be honest, it took me an hour at most. Then I went to the problem set 2. First I had to do the readability problem and you have no idea how many times I misspelled it lol. Then, I went for the problem. I decided to do Wordle50 cause I have played wordle before and I enjoy it a bit. Understanding the code was a bit of a problem cause there are many things you haven't actually studied yet, but ignoring them you can just complete the problem and submit. I would like to write more and I could, but I'm really tired, so bye.
