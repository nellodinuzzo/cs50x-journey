OK, I LOVED CREDIT. Where do I begin? Today to be honest I haven't done much in the morning, I didn't have things to do or anything but I was just tired. That changed after lunch.
I turned on the computer and immediately went to the CS50x site to start the new problem. I had to choose between Cash and Credit, I chose Credit cause like usual I wanted a challenge.
So, the problem was a bit confusing in the start. Not like I didn't know what to do (still, I didn't) but because it was very long and it had multiple steps.
I was able to understand the entire situation only after I divided the whole problem in various little problems. I started solving one by one. I had to make an algorithm which I really liked after I figured it out.
As I said in the start, I loved this project. It was challenging and it took me the entire afternoon (to be honest, I had A LOT of breaks, but shhh). This is actually scaring me a little, I'm only at week 1 and it's already hard?
Oh god, I don't want to imagine what's next. Speaking of that, it's a little late so I don't know if it's a good idea, but I want to watch the week 2 this evening. From what I understood I have finished week 2, so that's next.
I haven't wrote enough and I would like to write more but I don't have much else to say so I'll just end it here, bye lol.
