Ok, second day has gone and I'm here to tell you all about it. I woke up and the idea of making a blog just came in, randomly.
I have already done some projects like this, but to be honest I never completed them. I like to think I will complete this, though.
Anyway, I immediately decided to write this blog on the Github Pages. When the idea came in, I didn't really know their name was Github Pages,
I only remembered all those blogs with the link that ended in github.io and the fact the articles were very clean.
So I searched, and I found it. I tried to make one on my own, and it kinda worked but trash files were starting to add up and it was becoming a mess.
That was until I stumbled upon a Github official guide to make Github Pages. I just followed it, and then I was in business again (cit.).
I wrote the first day, as you may have seen, then went back to CS50. I watched the lesson, but didn't do the assignment.
I had some IRL things to do so the time just wasn't enough.

The lesson was very interesting though. I have some background in C++ so it was mostly things I already knew,
the syntax is pratically the same and that shocked me a little. I thought C and C++ were more different, but I guess it's only if you go in depth.
