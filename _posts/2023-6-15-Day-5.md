title: "Day 5 - 3rd lesson"
date: 2023-6-15

Today (yesterday for me) I was not able to do much sadly. I was almost all day outside, I only came back in the evening. When I did, I decided to use the little time I had to watch the 3rd lesson.\
I had to take some notes, it was very interting stuff. Some I already knew, some not so much. 
$cowsay didn't do much today
lol.
Anyway, I wasn't even able to write this, so here I am writing this late. By the way, I'm getting more and more confused with the dates of the articles, I have already changed them once and I won't do it again, but they may be wrong I don't know.
To finish this apology to myself with a better light, today I have already done some work and it's only morning, so I expect more in the day, so I guess I can fix what was not done yesterday.
I will publish the results this evening / tomorrow morning, idk, bye.
